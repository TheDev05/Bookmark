## About Project

* `Frontend: ` This project is made using MERN stack, so **ReactJS** is used as frontend. React has various advantages such as component-based architecture, faster rendering,stable code structure, SEO-enabled, handy developer tools, easy to Learn and easy to Use.

* `Backend: ` For the backend keeping in mind MERN stack, **NodeJS/ExpressJS** is used in backend which is a perfect combination with react because node is asynchronous, and dependent on event occurrences, compatibility with different devices,fast data streaming with no buffering, speedy code development and based on JavaScript.

* `Database:` For the database purpose to store user data, **MongoDB** is used because of full cloud-based developer data platform, flexible document schemas,change-friendly design, powerful querying and analytics, cost-effective i.e. free of cost and full technical support and documentation.

* `Responsive: ` The Web application is fully resposnive for all kind of dispaly size.
